           |   |   |   |
      screen pos    size

The size and position of the GOP on the sub-patch is in the coords line:
#X coords 0 -1 1 1 200 200 1 0 0;
                    |   |    | |
                     size    pos

#X restore 1 18 pd subPatch;
           |  |

mouseCanvas (as derived from receivecanvas) uses a proxy object to collect mouse events from its own or higher canvasses. canvasposition retrieves the GOP position on its parent or higher canvas. 
Confusing is that canvasposition 0 reports the position of the GOP on the parent canvas.
