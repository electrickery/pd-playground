<h2>GUI demo objects</h2>

<p>The GUI objects are intendend to demonstrate the structure of GUI-code for Pure Data.</p>

<p>GUI1 contains only the widget event structure, without any drawing on the canvas.</p>

<p>GUI2 adds an outline and inlet and outlet drawing on the canvas. Most events are logged to the console.</p>

<p>GUI3 is a simplified implementation of the comment object. It is as yet incomplete.</p>

<p>GUI4 is GUI2 but with zoom functionality (and some refactoring added)</p>

<p>GUI5 adds mouse control via the widgetbehaviour functionality (limited mouseup)</p>

<p>GUI6 adds better mouse control via the pd_bind proxy method</p>
