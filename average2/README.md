This is the average2~ object, a clone of the Max/MSP average~ object. It should have been an
object in the cyclone library, but because it already contained a average~ object with a 
control outlet, the backward compatibility with the cyclone library was found more important
than adherance to Max/MSP objects. Hence the separate distribution.

As the source is still very close to the cyclone/average~ object, the same BSD licence applies.
